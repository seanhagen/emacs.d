Sean Hagen's Emacs Config
=========================

![Game of Life Glider](./glider.png)

This is my Emacs config. There are many like it but this one is mine.

I'm always adding or removing stuff, or tweaking bits and pieces.

# NOTES 

A lot of stuff is hard-coded to my own home directory layout, so keep that in
mind if you want to use it.

# SCREENSHOTS
